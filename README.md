# ElectronBasins
Script written by Madison Genslinger to turn electron basin representations from critic2 to standard .cif files with working examples. Additional scripts for full automation QE->cif will be provided soon.
You can get these to work by writing 'python vestaplot.py critic.out' in the command line.
where critic.out is the output from critic2. Working examples from critic2 are included for Nb metal and Nb3Cl8. Note that the output uses H to represent the electron basins, for ease of use in vesta. If your compound has H in it, you may want to change the ion used to represent the basins.

HTML files are also provided that allow for direct visualization of electron localization bubbles as H atoms for two materials (Nb3Cl8 is presented in two phases, one with and one without a breathing distortion).
